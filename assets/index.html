            Java is a cross-plattform, object-oriented scripting language. It is
            a small and lightweiht language. Inside a host environment (For
            example, a web browser), Javascript can be connected to the objects
            of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Javascript contains a standard libary objects, such as Array, Date,
            and Math , and a core set of language elements such as operators,
            control structures, and statements . core Javascript can be extended
            for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
            objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <br />
            <li>
              Client-side javascript extend the core language by suppliying
              objects to control a browser and its Documents Object Model (DMO)
              . for example , cleint-side extentions allow an application to
              place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
              mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application or perform file manipulations on a
              server....

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <code>
            function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            <br />
            greetMe("World");</code
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!

        <br />
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        <br />
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <br />
        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <br />
        <p><code>var x = 42.</code></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <br />
        <p><code> x = 42.</code></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
          JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <br />
        <p><code>let y = 13.</code></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="variablescope" class="variablescope">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <article>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <code>
            if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            <br />
            defined
          </code>
